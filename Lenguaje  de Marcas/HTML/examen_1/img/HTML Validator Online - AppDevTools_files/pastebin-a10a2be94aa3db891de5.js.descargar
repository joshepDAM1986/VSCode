It's completely optional.\n\nSelect the `expiration` period that a paste will last for. It defaults to `Never` meaning that the paste will not be automatically deleted and will last as long as possible unless manually deleted via a request or report.\n\nLikewise, if you want a paste to be available online for a certain time period, such as 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 month before it gets deleted, you can select the appropriate expiration period accordingly.\n\nVerify that you're not a robot by checking `reCAPTCHA`, and then click the save button.\n\nOnce done, you'll be automatically redirected to the paste page, and a shortened link to the page will be provided for sharing.\n\nNo links are made public within the site.
